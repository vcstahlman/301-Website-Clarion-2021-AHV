                            <h5>Holly D. </h5>

                            <p>Holly is a CS major focusing in cybersecurity with a little game dev on the side that prefers a 
                                larger screen setup to make it easier on the eyes and be able to capture all of the graphics. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Her suggestions are: Have a large enough screen to not strain your eyes too much and to keep any 
                                wires as organized as possible. Having a tangled mess when you move anything around would not be good.

                            <p>Anna is a dual Marketing and Information Systems major who has always loved the joy that comes with 
                                having a sleek and stylish computer setup. Whether it’s for work or for play, Anna believes that 
                                you’ll always have the most enjoyable experience if your space is aesthetically pleasing. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Her suggestions are to never underestimate the importance of keeping your space visually appealing. 
                                There’s nothing wrong with investing in a few decorative items as long as they serve some sort of 
                                purpose, whether that purpose is practical or not!

                            <p>Victor is a CS major that has always been after the simpler laptop based setups from always 
                                working on the move. He can help you with any of your more mobile operations.</p>

                            <p>His suggestions are: Make sure to have a quiet mouse so you are not too loud in some quieter 
                                public places. Also make sure you have a good set of headphones so that you can isolate yourself 
                                from the crowd and get working when
                                you want to.
